Time on this part: 17
Total for the project: 25

Questions:
Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	If yes, why?
		I am more pleased than in my first round. 
	If no, why?
		I think it still could use some refinement and I was not able to get the slideshow to work. 
Is there anything you need from me?
	Do you have any resources on creating a slideshow? I tried two different approaches, one from web dev simplified and one from a different youtube channel and I couldn't get either to work.

Feedback/Fixes: 
Rene: Kara, the github link you have me goes to your raw files. If you want to give your URL so people can look at your website online, then that would be:
https://kara-evenson.github.io
The links within the text on your top-level index do not go to the desired pages. The nav links work, though.
I love what you say on the under construction pages.
I agree with a carousel of images for the homepage. It has a "shape up" look to it and perhaps a carousel will help. We want to avoid the "shape up" look.
Try custom fonts for the name and/or tagline. Remove the underlines on the nav.
There is an error on the page. It failed to load styles.slicknav.css. Check you href, it is not properly formed.

Fixes: I fixed the link to the slicknav style sheet and the links on the about us section to go to the correct pages.

Time on this part: 8 hour
Total for the project: 8 hour

Questions:
Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	If yes, why?

	If no, why?
		I am not super happy with my progress so far. There are more things I would like to do with the homepage, including turning the featured image into a carousel of images, and turning the featured rail images into links for products. There are also other smaller style things I plan on updating, including creating a logo for both my header and to use as a favicon. I'll be spending some extra time during spring break working on these parts. 
Is there anything you need from me?
	Not currently.

Feedback/Fixes:
Rene: 	Kara, sounds wonderful. This could morph to be your Apps Development project. You could also check out Darn Knit Away for website ideas. It's my favorite yarn shop.
Fixes:  No fixes needed, but I did check about the website.
