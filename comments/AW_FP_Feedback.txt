Feedback/Fixes: 
Rene: Kara, your site runs perfect from github. For the slideshow, did you try what we learned in Web Design? If you still have the student download code, then look in book_examples | ch15 | 06_animations. Here's https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations/Using_CSS_animations, which may help.
You are making good progress, but the style still reminds me of ShapeUp. Try rounding edges more and removing the gradient. You may need to also radius the header. Have you thought of an image in the header. Perhaps one that is subdued and behind the words.
You incorrectly reference index.js, so there's an error on your rendered page. On contact us, there is a label that does not have the correct "for" attribute. Take a look at your pages on Chrome with iPhone SE selected. Some pages need a bit more work. Also, on that small of a screen, your header text takes up too much real estate; shrink it. 
I am looking forward to your final product. Refresh my memory, is this an existing business?

Fixes: It is not an existing business. I definitely don't have the time on my end, and my mom hates working on any sort of deadline.I shrunk the header text on the small screen and removed the reference to index.js. I also found and fixed the for on my name label. 

For fixing the look of the page, I added a background image in the header, I used canva and created a quick checkerboard pattern out of the colors I'm using on my website.

FP 03 
--------------------------------------------------

Time on this part: 17
Total for the project: 25

Questions:
Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	If yes, why?
		I am more pleased than in my first round. 
	If no, why?
		I think it still could use some refinement and I was not able to get the slideshow to work. 
Is there anything you need from me?
	Do you have any resources on creating a slideshow? I tried two different approaches, one from web dev simplified and one from a different youtube channel and I couldn't get either to work.

Feedback/Fixes: 
Rene: Kara, the github link you have me goes to your raw files. If you want to give your URL so people can look at your website online, then that would be:
https://kara-evenson.github.io
The links within the text on your top-level index do not go to the desired pages. The nav links work, though.
I love what you say on the under construction pages.
I agree with a carousel of images for the homepage. It has a "shape up" look to it and perhaps a carousel will help. We want to avoid the "shape up" look.
Try custom fonts for the name and/or tagline. Remove the underlines on the nav.
There is an error on the page. It failed to load styles.slicknav.css. Check you href, it is not properly formed.

Fixes: I fixed the link to the slicknav style sheet and the links on the about us section to go to the correct pages.

FP 02
--------------------------------------------------
Time on this part: 8 hour
Total for the project: 8 hour

Questions:
Are you pleased with your progress so far?
	If yes, why?

	If no, why?
		I am not super happy with my progress so far. There are more things I would like to do with the homepage, including turning the featured image into a carousel of images, and turning the featured rail images into links for products. There are also other smaller style things I plan on updating, including creating a logo for both my header and to use as a favicon. I'll be spending some extra time during spring break working on these parts. 
Is there anything you need from me?
	Not currently.

Feedback/Fixes:
Rene: 	Kara, sounds wonderful. This could morph to be your Apps Development project. You could also check out Darn Knit Away for website ideas. It's my favorite yarn shop.
Fixes:  No fixes needed, but I did check about the website.
